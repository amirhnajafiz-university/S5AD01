In the previous problem, we distributed the numbers 1 to 46 as points between the page cells. 
If for each possible solution, the sum of location points
consider the placement of ministers as the advantage of that solution. 

Design and implement an optimal algorithm that takes just a number like x
Find and display solutions with a score greater than x.
