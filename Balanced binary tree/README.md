# Balanced binary tree 

### What is a balanced binary tree?
A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, 
is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.

### How to check if a binary tree is balanced?
We start from the root and we check the balanced status for each node. After that 
we check the heights of the sub-trees to check if the root is balanced or not.
