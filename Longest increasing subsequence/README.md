Input: arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output: Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input: arr[] = {3, 2}
Output: Length of LIS = 1
The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

Input: arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
Output: Length of LIS = 4
The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
