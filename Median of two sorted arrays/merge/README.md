1. Merge the two given arrays into one array.
2. Then sort the third(merged) array
3. If the length of the third array is even then :
    divide the length of array by 2
    return arr[value]  + arr[value - 1] / 2
    
4. If the length of the third array is odd then :
    divide the length of array by 2
    round that value 
    return the arr[value]
