In this repository, I represent my projects and practices in algorithm design.

## Course subjects
- Solve recursive relationships
    - the master theorem
    - recursive tree
- Heap sort
- Quick sort 
- Linear time sorting algorithms
    - Counting sort
    - Radix sort
    - Bucket sort
- Finding the median
    - selection problem
- Breaker analysis
- Algorithm designs
    - Divide and conqure
    - Dynamic programming
    - Backtracking
    - Branch and bound 
    - Greedy approach
