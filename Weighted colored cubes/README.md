Consider N numbers of the same size, each with a different weight. Each side of the cubes has a color.

We want to place the cubes on top of each other to design the tallest tower while observing the following:
- A) When placing one cube on top of another, the bottom face of the top cube should be the same color as the top face of the bottom cube.
- B) When placing one cube on top of another, the bottom cube should be heavier than the top cube.
